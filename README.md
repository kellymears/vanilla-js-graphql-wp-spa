# Vanilla JS Graph QL WordPress Single Page Application

Just a demo of how easy it can be to make a single page application out of your WordPress -- no real need for React, Gatsby, or any of the typical things you see.

I'm serving the footer as a reusable block which I've exposed to GraphQL. If you don't want to mess about with that you can just remove the call from `/src/app.js`. But, for my part it's how I'm currently serving templated components of the site.
